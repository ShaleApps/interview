## Back End Engineering Challenge

### Intro
Thanks for your interest in ShaleApps!

This coding challenge will hopefully not test the limits of your skills, but rather just show us:

 1. How you solve problems
 2. Your coding style
 3. How you would structure a project 

### Description
Build a go (golang) server side application exposing an API for managing a to do list.  
The API should allow adding, deleting, and viewing items.  Endpoints should accept and return JSON.  Don't worry about authentication.      

It should meet the following criteria:
 1. Utilize go's built in http server and handler interface
 2. Store items in a database (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.)
 3. Be version controlled in a Git repository
 4. Have test coverage for core functionality
 5. Implement CI/CD for deploying application publicly
