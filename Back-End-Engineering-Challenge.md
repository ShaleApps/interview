## Back End Engineering Challenge

### Intro
This engineering challenge is intended to show:

 1. How you rapidly develop solutions that are readable, maintainable, and follow best practices.
 2. How you would structure a project
 3. What skills, talents, and diverse perspectives you can bring to bear at Vorto

__Please ensure all work is done by only you.__ This challenge should only take you a few hours of focused effort. 

### Description
Build a Go web service for managing a to do list. Don't worry about authentication. RESTful / GRPC is fine.

It should meet the following criteria:
 1. Store items in a database. Postgres is perferred, but feel free to use any *relational/SQL* DB you are comfortable with.
 2. Be version controlled in a Git repository.
 3. Be deployed somewhere online. Preferably as a Docker container.
 4. Be built as if your teammates have to pick it up and work with it - including front-end folks

### When You're Done
Push your project to Github, and send us the following:
* Link to the git repository / Github
* Link to the deployed project
* Steps on how to use. Either in the email or README.
