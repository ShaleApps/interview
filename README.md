## Be a Pioneer.
We at ShaleApps aren’t an ordinary company. We are building a team of great minds with one common mission. We are a very mission-driven company focused on _“accelerating the evolution of mankind”_. Being part of a small company with a large mission like that can be pretty intense and isn’t a good alignment for everyone. However, the people we’ve hired who enjoy this challenge have told me they’ve grown immensely and have become better engineers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs as a result.

## About ShaleApps
ShaleApps makes North American energy more competitive globally. Using our mobile apps, E&P companies, service vendors, and truck drivers are working together more efficiently. We've built a sophisticated platform that automates most of the decision-making involved in oilfield logistics. Our customers love our product, and many have called it the "iPhone moment" for the industry.

We are based in beautiful Denver, CO and have field offices in major basins across the US. We have a team of 6 engineers and are looking to add at least 6 more over the next year. We are backed by Golden Gate Capital, a $15 billion private equity firm based in San Francisco.

## Interview Process
We are very selective in our hiring process. For one of our recent positions, we interviewed more than 90 qualified candidates to fill one role on our team. While going to an elite school and working for brand name companies isn't a bad thing – we don't focus on it. We look for candidates who are deeply intelligent, excited by our mission, and match our cultural values. We highly recommend you read more about this on our website in our ["Nutrition Facts" section](https://www.shaleapps.com/careers/).

## Cultural Values
ShaleApps is a small startup with a large mission: to make North American energy more competitive globally and thereby _"accelerate the evolution of mankind"_. Lower cost energy has an outsized impact on quality of life of the global poor and the acceleration of human progress. With a mission that important, we cannot compromise or slow down.

Not only do we have a large mission, but the industry we are focused on has not yet embraced what we call "digital transformation". The Oil & Gas industry in the United States makes abundant use of sensors to collect data and software to model reservoirs, but software hasn't yet changed how decisions are made for 99% of employees. We view this as a significant opportunity to create value by building tools that improve decision making and develop techniques that we can then apply to other verticals.

All of this leads to our cultural values, which we expound upon in some detail in [this article by our CEO](https://www.shaleapps.com/blog/2018/6/12/one-two-punch-for-transformational-innovation ). We have found these values to be the most critical thing to look for while growing our team.
