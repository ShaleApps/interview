# ShaleApps Engineering Challenge
This engineering challenge is intended to showcase:

 1. How you develop solutions
 2. Your coding style with respect to best practices
 3. How you would structure a project
 4. What skills, talents, and diverse perspectives you can bring to bear at ShaleApps

### Description
Build a Go server side application exposing an API for managing a to do list.
A web client UI will be required to interact with the API.

The API should consists the basic CRUD operations and provide functionality for typical todo list functions like:

* Adding tasks
* Displaying tasks
* Completing tasks
* Editing tasks
* Deleting tasks

Endpoints should accept and return JSON. Don't worry about authentication.

It should meet the following basic criteria:
 1. Store items in any database you are comfortable with (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.)
 2. Be version controlled in a Git repository
 3. Have test coverage for core functionality
 4. Include a docker file for building an image and running it locally
 5. It should be deployed somewhere online
 6. Include a README about your work

__Please ensure all work is done by only you.__
